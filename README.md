# SWT_model_misspecification
The files here accompany the paper 'Random effects misspecification in stepped wedge trials' (official citation and link to be added after publication).  

* Supplemental_R_code: Calculates validity and efficiency for a given SWT design and parameter settings.  

* Supplemental_System of equations: demonstrates finding roots to the system of equations described in the paper

* Supplemental_Full_model_roots: demonstrates finding roots to the system of equations described in the paper, for non-classic designs and other data-generating models not covered in the paper (e.g. both random time and treatment effects)

These files implement some potentially useful results, but are a work in progress and may need to be altered to fit different needs.  If you find errors, please contact Emily Voldal at voldal (at) uw (dot) edu.
